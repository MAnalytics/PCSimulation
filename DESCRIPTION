Description: Generates artificial spatio-temporal point patterns (stpp) by integrating 
  microsimulation and agent-based models. Allows a user to define the movement 
  properties of a set of "walkers" (an agents) distributed across a spatially 
  configured landscape. The interaction of the walkers (be it human offenders in a 
  crime analysis, foraging animals in a Wildlife study, or carriers in disease 
  transmission) with their environment results in the advent of new events, whose 
  spatiotemporal (ST) signatures are measurable at the global levels. These 
  signatures can be used in ST model testing and evaluation across wide variety of 
  fields in social and life sciences.
