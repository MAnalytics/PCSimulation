Title: Simulation of Socio-spatial and Temporal point patterns for Social Science Research
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Monsuru Adepeju [cre, aut]
Maintainer: MOnsuru Adepeju <monsuur2010@yahoo.com>
Description: Designed for simulating point patterns within a specified socio-spatial
  context and temporal configuration. The `stppSim` is particularly useful
  for certain georaphical point patterns, such as crime events, within a 
  a geographic domain where there is lack of availability of data, especially due 
  to confidential and privacy reasons.
