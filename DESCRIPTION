Title: Spatio-Temporal Point Process Simulation for Social Science Research
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Monsuru Adepeju [cre, aut]
Maintainer: MOnsuru Adepeju <monsuur2010@yahoo.com>
Description: Designed for simulating spatio-temporal point process
  of specified spatial and temporal signatures within a confined
  geographical boundary and time period. The package is particularly 
  useful for testing and evaluating the performances of newly 
  built spatio-temporal models in social science research. The 
  package is currently suited for simulation data length of 
  1-year period.
