Title: Spatial and Temporal Point Patterns Simulation for Social and Life Science Research
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Monsuru Adepeju [cre, aut]
Maintainer: Monsuru Adepeju <monsuur2010@yahoo.com>
Description: Generates artificial spatiotemporal (ST) point patterns 
  through the integration of microsimulation and agent-based models. 
  Allows a user to define the behaviours of a set of 'walkers' (agents, 
  objects, persons, etc.) whose interactions with the spatial (landscape) 
  and the temporal domains produce new point events. The resulting ST 
  patterns from the point cloud can be measured and utilized for spatial 
  and/or temporal model testings and evaluations. Application: With 
  increasingly limited availability of fine-grained spatially and 
  temporally stamped point data, the package provides an alternative 
  source of data for a wide range of fields in social and life sciences.
