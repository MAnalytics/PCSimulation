Title: Socio-spatial and Temporal Point Pattern Simulation for Social Science Research
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Monsuru Adepeju [cre, aut]
Maintainer: MOnsuru Adepeju <monsuur2010@yahoo.com>
Description: Designed for simulating point patterns within a socio-spatial
  and temporal configuration. Social phenomena, such as crime 
  and diseases can exhibit this type of point pattern configuration. 
  The datasets simulated by `stppSim` can be utilized for 
  model testing and evaluation in social science research.
